Homework 6 
1. Define hoisting and closures in JS. 
Hoisting moves variable and function declarations to the top before execution, while Closures allows functions to remember variables from their outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing.


2. What is PHP? What do server side languages do in web development? 


PHP is a server-side scripting language used for web development, while Server-side languages process user input, handle databases, and generate dynamic content before sending it to the browser.


3. What are some examples of how the PHP and JavaScript programming languages are alike and how they differ? 


Some similarities between PHP and JavaScript include that both are interpreted, weakly typed, and support object-oriented programming (OOP). One of their main differences is that PHP is used for backend logic and database interactions on the server, while JavaScript operates in the browser to manage interactivity.






4. Why pick PHP over another server-side scripting language like Python or Node? 


PHP is easy to learn and quite widely adopted, besides being cheap to run; thus, it is well suited for content-driven websites and simple web applications.




5. Compare and contrast echo and var_dump. 


Echo outputs simple content, while var_dump provides detailed information about variables, including their type and value, and is mainly used for debugging.


6. Create a new PHP project, in the index.php file create: 
a. An associative array with keys and values. 
b. Loop through the array and echo out a string that contains each key and value. 


7. Add to question 6: 
a. Create a function that has: 
i. a set return type 
ii. an optional parameter 
iii. a typed parameter 
iv. and call your function with values that have the correct data types 


8. Create another PHP project that includes a “resources” directory. In the resources directory create an HTML file that has elements to show an image, also place an image in the resources directory. When the domain is accessed in a browser(localhost), return the HTML page with the working image.
